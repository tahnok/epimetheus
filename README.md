# Epimetheus

Help yourself look forwards, by looking backwards.

This is a simple app to help people track themselves over time.

## Goals

 * Flexible enough to track anything
 * Really easy to enter data
 * Give you information about your habits

## I still don't get it... could you give me an example?

Sure! Imagine you want to start tracking your weight, or you hours spent mastering the unicycle, or whether you remember to water your plants everday. This app should help you out with that by letting you ask the questions about you that you want and making it really easy to answer.

## Getting started

Should be as easy as deploying this puppy to heroku! I may have a hosted instance at some point. Not sure yet.

## License and registration

License, GPLv3. See the file named copying for more details.
